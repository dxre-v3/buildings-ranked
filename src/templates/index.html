        <div id = "intro">
          <p>For my 14th birthday, my parents took me on an architectural boat tour of Chicago. It was early July, so other kids were attending summer camp or playing with friends – but I was afraid of being away from my family at summer camp and didn’t have friends, so here I was. The city’s soaring skyscrapers had always fascinated me, and as I sat cruising down the sunny Chicago River on that summer day, a love took hold. In high school, I briefly considered studying architecture but ultimately decided on journalism. That fascination with the design and planning of buildings stayed with me, though.</p>

          <p>University Hall, Northwestern’s oldest standing building, celebrates its 150th birthday this year. Since its limestone blocks were stacked, the university has seen vast changes, from shifting architectural styles to expanding campus into the lake. Early buildings at Northwestern prized neo-gothic and classical styles with ornate archways, stonework and columns adding visual excitement. The postwar era heralded the rise of more practical modernism, which prioritized function over form. In the ‘60s and ‘70s, Walter Netsch of prominent Chicago firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill made his mark on campus with a number of (awful) concrete brutalist behemoths, most notably Main Library. Today, Northwestern’s most notable additions are the lakefront “glass castles” like the Ryan Center for the Musical Arts (S.S. Bienen) and the Kellogg Global Hub, filled with natural light, high-quality materials and environmentally friendly innovations.</p>

          <p>Stepping onto campus in fall 2016, I witnessed a whole host of unique structures for the first time. The beautiful materials inside of the S.S. Bienen took my breath away and the corridors and stacks of Main Library confused me. Even off campus, the stunning stonework of the Bahá'í Temple forever embedded itself in my memory.</p>

          <p>Two and a half years later, I’ve seen and experienced, to some degree, all 40 of Northwestern’s core academic buildings – that is, buildings on the Evanston campus where students have classes or other academic activities, excluding dorms, athletic facilities and those houses that hold academic offices. And I’ve developed some opinions about them.</p>

          <p>I based my ranking on each building’s exterior and interior aesthetics, practicality, likability and overall vibes. In other words: A building’s design is important, but there’s more to it than that. These structures are where we spend our time on campus – where we take classes, study, make friends, create memories – and they are essential parts of how we relate to this school. Buildings can invoke comfort, awe, boredom and any assortment of experiences Northwestern students have.</p>

          <p>Whether you spend whole days in Tech or crisscross campus from Kresge to Francis Searle, there are campus buildings that have defined your Northwestern experience. Let’s explore them all.</p>
